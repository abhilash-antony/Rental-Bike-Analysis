# Cyclistic Bike Usage Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the bike usage patterns of Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company. The goal is to understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. By leveraging Python and Excel, I performed comprehensive data analysis, revealing key insights and providing actionable recommendations to enhance the user experience and support strategic decision-making.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Used for data processing, cleaning, and visualization.
- **Excel**: Utilized for additional data manipulation and analysis.

## Key Highlights

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, performed KNN imputation, and prepared the data for analysis.
- **Ride Duration Analysis**: Analyzed ride durations to identify usage patterns, with a maximum ride duration observed of over 68 days, indicating potential outliers.
- **Rideable Type Distribution**: Compared the preferences for electric, classic, and docked bikes between members and casual riders.
- **Seasonal Trends**: Examined monthly usage trends, showing peak usage in summer and a significant drop in winter for both member types.
- **Day of the Week Analysis**: Investigated the number of rides on each day of the week, finding higher activity on weekends for casual riders.
